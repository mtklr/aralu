# Aralu

Aralu is a roguelike (with time-based movement) by Andrew Vassallo from 1991, found in the [DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECUS) [Library Compendium](http://www.decuslib.com).

I've fixed enough so it works (macOS 10.14/ncurses, ymmv).

If you have any information about this game and its history, I'd love to hear about it.
